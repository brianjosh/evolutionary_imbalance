This provides the code and datafiles necessary to repeat the analyses described in 'Plants from regions of high phylogenetic diversity have higher invasion success, particularly in undisturbed communities' (Brian, van Kleunen, Dawson, Kempel, Catford). Analyses and usage of all other files is carried out in 'Brian_etal_code.R', except for 'Variable_table.docx', which provides details on all explanatory and response variables used in 'Brian_etal_code.R'. Questions should be directed to Joshua Brian (jshbrian@gmail.com).
